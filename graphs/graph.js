// UNDIRECTED GRAPH

// A good way to think about a directed graph is to think of as a highway between two cities where you
// can go back and forth

// think of it as a doubly linked list, where you can go both ways with then next and previous 




// DIRECTED GRAPH

// a directed graph will only be one way street where you can only go one way 
// think of it as a linked list where you can only go one way with the next 



// Weighted Graphs

// UNWEIGHTED



// WEIGHETED

// with weighted graphs you can have informations in the edges and the connetions maybe you're going on a trip
// and trying to figure out the most effecient way to visit sites that interest you
// Google maps would use a weighted graph to decided what is the shortest path
// to get there and these sort of grapsh are used a lot in calculating optiomal paths
